Version: 0.37
Github: https://github.com/martijnvanbrummelen/nwipe 

Installation of Nwipe:
Nwipe will need to be downloaded and compiled.
The files here can be manually edited after Nwipe is compiled, and a full re-compile from beginning is not required, but you will need to re-run make command and relaunch Nwipe to see the changes.

Description:
In the default Nwipe application the background colors and text may dynamically change depending on terminal display environment.
The common background may be dark blue with white text, or light blue with white text.

The files in this repository are an attempt to make the colors always be the same regardless of where or from where the Nwipe app is being launched from.

In addition, the menus and wording have been slightly modified to help try to make the navigation simpler.
